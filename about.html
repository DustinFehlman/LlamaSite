                <h3>Hello! My name is Dustin, and you have reached my Llama website.</h3>

                <h3>I created this site to fulfill the challenge that is a part of the Jr. FEZ Badge.
                    I started programming back in 2014 when I attended a 3 month Zappos Tech program. In the program, we
                    were taught
                    Java, and given different projects to complete. The program was a great way to learn the foundation
                    of
                    development,
                    and is the reason I now study Computer Science at UNLV.
                </h3>

                <h3>
                    After the program, I started to try out different programming languages. Javascript, CSS, and HTML
                    really
                    caught my attention. I enjoy the artistic aspect of designing a page, and the problem solving that
                    comes
                    with
                    using Javascript. I am eager to learn more, and am hoping to gain deeper knowledge, and guidance
                    that
                    will
                    enable me to become a better creator.
